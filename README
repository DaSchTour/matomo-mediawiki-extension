MediaWiki Piwik Integration extension

version 1.5.2-piwik0.5.5
24 April 2010

This is the README file for the Piwik Integration extension for MediaWiki
software. The extension is only useful if you've got a MediaWiki
installation; it can only be installed by the administrator of the site.

== Minimum requirements ==

* MediaWiki 1.14+

* A Piwik (0.4+) installation with the site configured

== Installation instructions ==

Please, read them carefully. They're not very difficult to understand,
but ALL steps are necessary:

* Create a folder called "piwik" in your extensions directory

* Upload Piwik.php, Piwik.i18n.php, Piwik_specialpage.php and Piwik.alias.php
  to the "piwik" folder you've just created

* Edit your LocalSettings.php and, at the end of the file, add the
  following:

        require_once('/extensions/piwik/Piwik.php');


* Then, you need to define where Piwik is installed and the "idsite".
  To do it, just add after the require_once:

        $wgPiwikURL = "piwik-host.tld/dir/"; //Don't include the protocol
        $wgPiwikIDSite = "piwik_idsite";

  Note: Change the value of $wgPiwikURL with the URL, without the protocol
	but including the domain name, where you installed Piwik.
	Remember to add the trailing slash!

        Change the value of $wgPiwikIDSite with your site ID.
        For example, in:

		<!-- Piwik -->
		<script type="text/javascript">
		var pkBaseURL = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://piwik-host.tld/dir/" : "http://piwik-host.tld/dir/");
		document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + pkBaseURL + "piwik.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
		</script><script type="text/javascript">
		try {
		var piwikTracker = Piwik.getTracker(pkBaseURL + "piwik.php", 3);
		piwikTracker.trackPageView();
		piwikTracker.enableLinkTracking();
		} catch( err ) {}
		</script><noscript><p><img src="http://piwik-host.tld/dir/piwik.php?idsite=3" style="border:0" alt=""/></p></noscript>
		<!-- End Piwik Tag -->

        the $wgPiwikIDSite is 3


* You can also set $wgPiwikCustomJS if you want to add custom javascript
  tags (see http://piwik.org/docs/javascript-tracking/ for further
  information). For example:

            $wgPiwikCustomJS = "piwikTracker.trackGoal(1); // logs a conversion for goal 1
                                piwikTracker.setDownloadExtensions( \"jpg|png|gif\" ); // we now only track clicks on images";

* If you want to change the title of your pages inside the Piwik tracker,
  you can set $wgPiwikActionName inside your LocalSettings.php file.

** In case you want to include the title as, for example,
   "wiki/Title of the page", you can set $wgPiwikUsePageTitle to
   true and set $wgPiwikActionName to "wiki/". The extension will print

			piwik_action_name = 'wiki/Title of the page';

* Since 0.8 (1.0-RC3), you can choose which users can see the special page
  setting the following in LocalSettings.php

			$wgGroupPermissions['usergroup']['viewpiwik'] = true;

  Where 'usergroup' is the name of the group. By default, only sysops can
  see the special page. If you want to allow bureaucrats to see the page,
  add that line with 'bureaucrat' where 'usergroup' is. The same is for
  normal users ('user') and anonymous users ('*').

* Since 1.5.2, you can set the date for the countries and browsers information in
  the special page, setting $wgPiwikSpecialPageDate to either today or yesterday.
